# Text-Mining
my assignments during semester 5 with java (preprocessing and term frequency)

Using data in the form of news as much as 5 to do:
- preprocessing(cleaning, case_folding, tokenization, filtering with stopword list tala, and stemming with indonesian stemmer.jar)
- weighting with term frequency.
